# Description of Work:

## Goals / Defining Problem:

Banner Financial Analytics was hired by Amazon do conduct a time series analysis on the stock price using 10 years of data taken daily.  All data was obtained from the Yahoo Finance APi. This project will provide a brief overview of stock, establish price trends, and use traditional and nontraditional Time Series Models for analysis


   
### Results and Future Work:

BANNER FINANCIAL ANALYTICS RECOMENDATIONS:

* Based on financial modeling WOULD recommend an investment into Amazon.
* Facebook Prophet overall yielded the best forecasts, predictions, and visualizations. 
* In terms of traditional autoregressive models, ARMA performed the best in terms of RMSE
* These models can be used in conjunction with other machine learning models and stacked in the future. 
* Future work would include creating additional predictive models with Neural Networks
* Narrowing the focus to more smaller time increments(minute by minute data) to allow more accurate short term predictions.
